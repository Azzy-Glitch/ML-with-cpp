What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning is a branch of AI that enables computers to learn patterns from data and make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed.

Can C++ be Used for ML?
Absolutely! While Python is the most popular ML language, C++ is also widely used for tasks that require performance and memory optimization. Libraries like MLPack and Dlib are great tools to start with.
